# Qiskit-Introduction

This repository is for storing Jupyter notebooks as I experiment with the quantum programming language Qiskit.

I have some introductory notebooks here that should be easy to follow for anyone looking for more resources to learn about quantum computing.

I am by no means an expert in quantum computing, but I find this topic interesting!
